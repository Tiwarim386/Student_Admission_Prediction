# Student_Admission_Prediction
A 2-layer Neural network which Predicts whether the student will get admitted to the university or not on the basis of data of previous years.
  
  The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
  
  NN predicts student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
- GRE Scores (Test)
- GPA Scores (Grades)
- Class rank (1-4)
  
  Neural network starts off with random weights and then decreases the error and corrects the weights using the Backpropagation Algorithm.
  
  Despite having a very small and unpredictable data-set of just 400 entries the Neural network achieves an accuracy of 75%.
